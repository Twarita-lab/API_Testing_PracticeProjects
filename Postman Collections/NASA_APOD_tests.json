It is hard to predict because the Moon's appearance changes nightly.  As the Moon orbits the Earth, the half illuminated by the Sun first becomes increasingly visible, then decreasingly visible. The featured video animates images and altitude data taken by NASA's Moon-orbiting Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to show all 12 lunations that appear this year, 2022 -- as seen from Earth's northern (southern) hemisphere. A single lunation describes one full cycle of our Moon, including all of its phases. A full lunation takes about 29.5 days, just under a month (moon-th). As each lunation progresses, sunlight reflects from the Moon at different angles, and so illuminates different features differently.  During all of this, of course, the Moon always keeps the same face toward the Earth. What is less apparent night-to-night is that the Moon's apparent size changes slightly, and that a slight wobble called a libration occurs as the Moon progresses along its elliptical orbit.\",\n        \"media_type\": \"video\",\n        \"service_version\": \"v1\",\n        \"title\": \"Moon Phases 2022\",\n        \"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c4Xky6tlFyY?rel=0&VQ=HD720\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"date\": \"2022-02-02\",\n        \"explanation\": \"What's happening at the center of our galaxy?

The featured picture shows the latest image of our Milky Way's center by the MeerKAT array of 64 radio dishes in South Africa.

Many known sources are shown in clear detail, including many with a prefix of Sgr, since the galactic center is in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.  In our Galaxy's Center lies Sgr A, found here in the image center, which houses the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole.  Other sources in the image are not as well understood, including the Arc, just to the left of Sgr A, and numerous filamentary threads.

With binoculars you can watch as R Aquarii steadily changes its brightness over the course of a year or so. The binary system's visible light is dominated by the red giant, itself a Mira-type long period variable star. But material in the cool giant star's extended envelope is pulled by gravity onto the surface of the smaller, denser white dwarf, eventually triggering a thermonuclear explosion, blasting material into space. Astronomers have seen such outbursts over recent decades. Evidence for much older outbursts is seen in these spectacular structures spanning almost a light-year as observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (in red and blue).

Between the two is a gap that appears almost completely dark.  How Hoag's Object formed remains unknown, although similar objects have now been identified and collectively labeled as a form of ring galaxy.  Genesis hypotheses include a galaxy collision billions of years ago and the gravitational effect of a central bar that has since vanished. The above photo taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in July 2001 revealed unprecedented details of Hoag's Object. More recent observations in radio waves indicate that Hoag's Object has not accreted a smaller galaxy in the past billion years.  Hoag's Object spans about 100,000 light years and lies about 600 million light years away toward the constellation of the Snake (Serpens).

The next attempt will be on Thursday. The main problem is that the Martian atmosphere is too thick to ignore -- or it will melt your spacecraft.  On the other hand, the atmosphere is too thin to rely on parachutes -- or your spacecraft will crash land.  Therefore, as outlined in the featured video, the Perseverance lander will lose much of its high speed by deploying a huge parachute, but then switch to rockets, and finally, assuming everything goes right, culminate with a hovering Sky Crane that will slowly lower the car-sized Perseverance rover to the surface with ropes.  It may sound crazy, but the Curiosity rover was placed on Mars using a similar method in 2012.  From atmospheric entry to surface touch-down takes about seven minutes, all coordinated by an onboard computer because Mars is too far away for rapid interactive communication.  During this time, humans on Earth will simply wait to hear if the landing was successful. Last week, UAE's Hope spacecraft successfully began orbiting Mars, followed a day later by the Chinese Tianwen-1 mission, which will likely schedule a landing of its own rover sometime in the next few months.
